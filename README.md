# INTERPAUL UI 80's style

This is a version of an interpol page as if could appear on a 80's movie.
It runs with the real public data given by the official interpol API. 

# ONCE YOU CLONE THE CODE

Run ``npm run dev``

to execute the web server on your browser

# ALSO IN THIS WEB

I use an open API with trivia question to put some emotion to the login component. This way you have to acreditate as an angel knowing the right answer for the trivia to have access to criminal file.

You can find this api on https://opentdb.com/


# About React + Vite used

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
